# FAIRY: Feature-domain optimization with Arbitrary constrains for Intensity-based wavefront RecoverY
<br>
This is the MATLAB code for implementation of FAIRY, an optimization framework for intensity-based wavefront recovery.
<br>

## Contents
This repository contains the implementation of FAIRY for two wavefront tasks which are
**(1) Computational holography** <br>
**(2) Feature-domain Fourier ptychography** <br>
<br>
<br>
