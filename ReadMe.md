# FAIRY: Feature-domain optimization with Arbitrary constrains for Intensity-based wavefront RecoverY
<br>
This is the MATLAB code for implementation of FAIRY, an optimization framework for intensity-based wavefront recovery. 
FAIRY is a wavefront retrieval engine that recovers for a broad class of wavefront through unique non-convex, high-dimensional, feature-domain optimization with arbitrary constrains.
Optimizations of the non-convex loss function are regarded as supervised-learning, solved by complex-backpropagation.


## Contents
This repository contains the implementation of FAIRY for two wavefront tasks which are <br>
**(1) Computational holography** <br>
**(2) Feature-domain Fourier ptychography** <br>
<br>
<br>

## How does it works?
